At this point they are SUPER nutrient-dense, having built up and collected all of the energy they needs before their big transformation. That’s exactly when they’re harvested, and properly dried to conserve their rich nutritional profile (not microwave dried like most brands)… Yummy!</span></p></div></div><div data-pf-type="Accordion.Content.Wrapper" class="sc-bjLpWZ eAwMnq pf-ddb5"><button type="button" data-header-id="b5ca89dd-b540-4068-803b-56008bdde33c" data-active="false" data-pf-type="Accordion.Header" class="sc-dILjMz dRBjiH pf-b540"><i class="pfa pfa-plus pfa-arrow"></i><span>How are BSF Larvae different than Dried Mealworms?</span></button><div data-pf-expandable="true" data-id="b5ca89dd-b540-4068-803b-56008bdde33c" style="display:none" data-pf-type="Accordion.Content" class="sc-ieCRpK glnENF pf-9068"><p class="sc-jePOVA eyTBns pf-fe19" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ZWpAl fKFbvj pf-0c73">Mealworms have been the go-to protein treat for chickens, but the black soldier fly larva has become more popular for many good reasons. <br>On top of providing a hearty amount of quality proteins with a full amino-acid profile, as well as healthy Omega fats, our BSF Larvae have 50-100x more Calcium than Mealworms. Good strong eggshells and proper endocrine function depend on calcium, AND its relationship with phosphorus in feed – and these larvae certainly deliver!<br>BSF Larvae are the only larva/worm/grub to even come near the ideal calcium phosphorous ratio, which truly makes them a nutritional powerhouse.

Rather we hope to add elements of information for consumers to use at their discretion. We’ve been to China ourselves to explore and study BSF production techniques, and saw first-hand the substrates used in the process. So, we do respectfully speak from experience.*<br>Not only are most Mealworms on the market imported from China, but many BSF Larvae brands too! <br>They understandably aim to capitalize on the growing attention given to BSF Larvae’s nutritional benefits, but they do so while discreetly sidestepping a crucial factor – the often problematic origin of how their larvae are actually produced..! <br>Our Bugs for Birds are raised on quality, pre-consumer-grade, and traceable fruit, grains, and vegetable waste here in the Pacific Northwest. Chinese-produced grubs can be raised off of food waste that is the downstream product of industries with very poor health &amp; safety standards, all with heavy exposure to different forms of pollution! Disproportionate presence of heavy metals and other contaminants are problematic, at the origin of an edible treat for feathered backyard pets whose eggs many of us consume! After all, you are what you eat. <br>While it is hard to compete with Chinese pricing, we do our best! Bugs for Birds aims to be the most affordable North American-raised BSF Larvae supplier on the market, keeping our margins just high enough to maintain and run our business – and offering steep discounts to our loyal customers via our Subscribe and Save 15% program&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div data-pf-type="Accordion.Content.Wrapper" class="sc-bjLpWZ eAwMnq pf-ede3"><button type="button" data-header-id="e33c8aed-e3bf-4ca6-be60-e0d9f74fadb9" data-active="false" data-pf-type="Accordion.Header" class="sc-dILjMz dRBjiH pf-e3bf"><i class="pfa pfa-plus pfa-arrow"></i><span>How much should I feed my chickens?

You can spread the grubs out to encourage the natural foraging behavior of scratching and pecking… Or like many customers, use our delicious treats as a way to get your flock back in the coop after you’ve let them out!  <br>During Molting, we strongly encourage you to increase your servings, which will do wonders for your birds’ feather growth! A small handful per bird, will yield noticeable results. <br>For chicks, the grubs are an ideal way to provide the crucial nutrients needed for healthy growth.

Chickens don’t have the ability to “taste” things the way we and other animals do. Relying first on their sight and then on the taste buds at the very back of their beak, they in some way have to commit to eating something before they can actually taste it.<br>So, when something new or different is introduced it can happen that they initially seem picky. The solutions are to gradually introduce new foods in small amounts, and be patient – for picky eaters it can take from a few hours even to several days before they come around.
